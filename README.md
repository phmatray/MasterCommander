## 🏁 Getting started

Use your favorite CLI tools without leaving your code editor:

This example demonstrates how to use MasterCommander to create a new .NET solution and project, initialize a Git
repository, and build and run the project.
In addition, this code adds a .gitignore file, an .editorconfig file, and a global.json file to the project.

```csharp
private const string SdkVersion = "8.0.*";
private const string SolutionName = "AppDemo";
private const string ConsoleProjectName = $"{SolutionName}.Console";
private const string ConsoleProjectDirectory = $"src/{ConsoleProjectName}";
private const string ConsoleCsproj = $"{ConsoleProjectDirectory}/{ConsoleProjectName}.csproj";

await git.InitAsync();
await git.StatusAsync();
await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewGitignoreOptions());
await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewEditorConfigOptions());
await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewNuGetConfigOptions());
await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewGlobalJsonOptions { SdkVersion = SdkVersion });
await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewSolutionOptions { OutputName = SolutionName });
await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewConsoleOptions { OutputName = ConsoleProjectName, OutputDirectory = ConsoleProjectDirectory });
await dotnet.SlnAddAsync(ConsoleCsproj);
await git.AddAsync("*");
await dotnet.BuildAsync();
await dotnet.BuildAsync(new DotnetBuildOptions { Configuration = "Release" });
await dotnet.RunAsync(new DotnetRunOptions { Project = ConsoleCsproj, Configuration = "Release" });
```

You can standardize your development workflow by using MasterCommander to perform common tasks across multiple projects
and technology stacks.

Output from MasterCommander commands is displayed in a clean, readable format:

#### We use the latest C# features

This library targets .NET 8.0 and uses the latest C# features. It is written in C# 12.0 and uses the new `init`
properties, `record` types, `switch` expressions, `using` declarations and more.

I invite you to read the [C# 12.0 documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-12) to
learn more about these features.

You can also build MasterCommander from source. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory and build the project using the .NET CLI: `dotnet build`.
3. Run the application with `dotnet run` from within the source directory.
4. Or... open the project in Visual Studio (or JetBrains Rider) and run the application from the IDE.
