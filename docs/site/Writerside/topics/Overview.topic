    <p>MasterCommander revolutionizes the development workflow by offering a unified command-line utility that
        integrates seamlessly with multiple technology stacks. It caters to developers juggling tasks across Git, .NET,
        Docker, and npm, providing a single interface to streamline project setup, management, and execution processes.
        By encapsulating the complexity of using different tools for various tasks, MasterCommander not only boosts
        productivity but also elevates the development experience, enabling developers to focus more on writing code
        rather than managing commands.</p>

    <chapter title="Getting Started" id="getting-started">
        <p>MasterCommander is straightforward to set up and use. It's designed to get you up and running quickly with
            minimal configuration, allowing you to integrate it into your existing development environment with ease.
            From source code management with Git to managing Docker images and handling npm packages, MasterCommander
            provides clear, concise commands to perform a wide range of tasks efficiently.</p>
        <p>Here's a practical example demonstrating how MasterCommander streamlines the development process:</p>

        <code-block lang="c#">
            private const string SdkVersion = &quot;8.0.101&quot;;
            private const string SolutionName = &quot;AppDemo&quot;;
            private const string ConsoleProjectName = $&quot;{SolutionName}.Console&quot;;
            private const string ConsoleProjectDirectory = $&quot;src/{ConsoleProjectName}&quot;;
            private const string ConsoleCsproj = $&quot;{ConsoleProjectDirectory}/{ConsoleProjectName}.csproj&quot;;

            await git.InitAsync();
            await git.StatusAsync();
            await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewGitignoreOptions());
            await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewEditorConfigOptions());
            await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewNuGetConfigOptions());
            await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewGlobalJsonOptions { SdkVersion = SdkVersion });
            await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewSolutionOptions { OutputName = SolutionName });
            await dotnet.NewAsync(new DotnetNewConsoleOptions { OutputName = ConsoleProjectName, OutputDirectory =
            ConsoleProjectDirectory });
            await dotnet.SlnAddAsync(ConsoleCsproj);
            await dotnet.BuildAsync();
            await dotnet.BuildAsync(new DotnetBuildOptions { Configuration = &quot;Release&quot; });
            await dotnet.RunAsync(new DotnetRunOptions { Project = ConsoleCsproj, Configuration = &quot;Release&quot;
            });
        </code-block>
        <p>This code snippet showcases the ease of creating a new .NET solution, initializing a Git repository, and
            performing build and run operationsâ€”all through MasterCommander's intuitive interface.</p>
